# Assumptions

**Assumptions**
- Carriers will decide which OS will connect to which towers.
- An equipment on Towers will detect the devices, and report App usage
- Two types of data is being sent a) real time app usage updates b) from the carriers about tower metadata (like which tower supports which carrier, new tower added etc)
- the decision to allow or deny from the policy service is sent back to tower
